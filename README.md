# SQL Menu Sales Analysis Project

## 📊 Project Overview

This project explores sales and ordering patterns from a restaurant menu dataset using SQL. The goal is to uncover insights about menu performance, customer behavior, and revenue trends. The findings help stakeholders identify best‑selling items, underperforming items, and peak business hours.

## 📝 Key SQL Findings

### **1. Total Number of Times Each Menu Item Was Ordered**

Identify how often each menu item appears in customer orders to discover the most frequently ordered items.

### **2. Number of Times Each Category Was Ordered**

Analyze order counts grouped by menu category (e.g., Drinks, Mains, Desserts) to understand category-level performance.

### **3. Top-Performing Menu Items by Revenue**

Calculate revenue per menu item using price × quantity, then rank items by total revenue generated.

### **4. Top 5 Most Ordered Items**

Highlight the best-selling items based on order frequency.

### **5. Top-Selling Item for Each Day**

Determine the highest‑selling menu item for each calendar day to understand daily customer preferences.

### **6. Busiest Hour of the Day**

Identify peak ordering hours by grouping orders by hour to understand when customer traffic is highest.

### **7. Items That Were Never Ordered**

Detect menu items with zero recorded sales—useful for menu optimization or promotional strategies.

### **8. Monthly Revenue Trend**

Track monthly revenue totals to observe growth patterns, seasonal changes, or dips in sales.
